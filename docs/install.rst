This is the official documentation to configure and install the eTokenServer servlet (v2.0.4).

This document provides an in-depth overview of the light-weight crypto library, a standard-based solution developed by INFN Catania for central management of robot credentials and provisioning of digital proxies to get seamless and secure access to computing e-Infrastructures supporting the X.509 standard for Authorisation.

In this solution robot certificates are available 24h per day on board of USB eToken PRO [1_] 32/64 KB smart cards having the following technical specification:
